<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am on a mission to build solutions to world's biggest problems. I know this would definitely not come easy. To achieve this big dream, I have been equipping myself with relevant skillsets and broadening my networks to set me on the right pedestal.</p>

<p>I recently completed a 3-month intensive Software Development training with Microsoft ATO / Elev8 Education where I was exposed to basics of programming. This proved helpful and stimulating as I had no prior knowledge of programming. During this program, I got exposed to server-side and client-side technologies such as .Net frameworks (Asp .net core), JavaScript frameworks (Node.js, React.js, Angular.js, Express.js).</p>

<p>In addition, I recently got accepted into the Alx_Africa Full Stack Software Engineering program. I got enrolled into the 9th Cohort for year 2022 which would last for 12-months with 70hr/week commitment. This sounds scary and demanding but according to Mr. Fred Swaniker during his speech at the 2019 TIME 100 Gala in New York, he said; “The only way that we can justify privilege is by solving the world’s biggest problems, and by doing hard things.”. I am ready to stay focused and committed to the very end in order to maximize this new opportunity of becoming a valuable Software Engineer. Up till now, I have picked up and developed some core skillsets which I believe would be of great advantage to me and any organization I find myself.</p>

<p>I hope to join an organization that share same values as mine and that demand excellence from her people as I have strong growth mindset and I am highly result oriented.</p>
